# Virtual PC

This is a personal project inspired by [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

This repository includes a virtual build of the Hack computer, developed in the mentioned course.

The implementation is done in a Minecraft world using redstone components, which simulate electricity in some way
***
Project's status is: **In progress**
